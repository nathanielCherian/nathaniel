The presocratic philosopher Parmenides argues that there can only be one unchanging thing by starting with the simple premise that everything is either “being” or “not being”. What exists, either in the world or in our mind is “being”, what is impossible to conceive is “not being”. 

Moreover, there can only be what is possible, for what is impossible cannot exist, either in the world or in our minds. Parmenides says that even thinking about ‘non-beings’ is, “a path entirely unable to be investigated: For neither can you know what is not (for it is not to be accomplished) nor can you declare it“ (p27). For example, a “square-triangle” is a non-being. It is impossible to even imagine this because a “square-triangle” itself is a contradiction. 

Using the idea of “being” vs “not being”, Parmenides explains why there can only be one whole and complete “being” using a reductio ad absurdum argument where he assumes the opposite of his position and shows a contradiction to prove his own position as true. 

It starts with the simple premise: the universe must be either one or many things. If there are many, they must all be “like” because all share the common attribute of “being”, that is, they exist. However, the many objects must also be different than each other to preserve their distinctiveness.  

Parmenides poetically exposes this contradiction, writing, “Nor is [being] divisible, since it is all alike, and not at all more in any way, which would keep it from holding together, or at all less, but it is all full of what-is” (p29). 

To even have “many” there must be some “unlikeness”. However, it is a contradiction to say that the many are both “like” and “unlike”. This avenue of thinking leads to a contradiction therefore it must be the case that the being is one. 

In this argument, Parmenides reduces the description of each of the “things” to be defined by only one attribute: “being” or “not being”. Because the “many” must exist, it must be the case that all have the common attribute of “being”. However, if they all have the common attribute of “being”, there is no way to distinguish the many beings from each other because there are no other attributes to distinguish them with. If it is the case that they have different attributes, then one of the many can only be “not-being” which is illegal according to Parmenides. Thus, there can only be one thing. 

Parmenides also explains why change is impossible using the basic principle that “being” cannot come from “not being”. He rejects the philosophy of earlier presocratics who attribute change to be the “rising” and “perishing” of the [arche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#Ancient_Greek_philosophy). He shows that “rising” implies a “coming from” and points out the flaw that what is “being” could only have come from what is “being” and not from what is “not being”. 

Parmenides writes, “How and from what did [being] grow? From what-is-not I will allow you neither to say nor to think: For it is not to be said or thought that it is not.” (p28). When something that exists rises, it must rise from something that exists, but it is impossible for a “being” to come from a “not being”. It is impossible for a “non-being” to even exist, so then it is unreasonable to posit that a “being” came from something inconceivable. 

For this reason, Parmenides rejects the idea of “becoming” and thus also rejects change as it is a byproduct of “becoming”. He also explains why the “being” itself cannot change, as the whole being is maximally complete. He compares this idea of being with a ball that is “well-rounded from all sides equally matched in every way from the middle” (p29). 

It is impossible to say that the ball undergoes change as every part of the ball is identical to every other part of the ball. Similarly, the “being” has only one quality: existing. It is impossible for one part of the “being” to be less or more “existing” than another part. Therefore, change is impossible.
