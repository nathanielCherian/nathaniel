# Why am I in college
I'm going to write this quick. It is just a thought that popped into my head the other day. 

If you don't know I am about to finish my first year towards a CS degree at Purdue University.

But why did I need to do this. Looking back on the year, I am down $45,000 but what have I got.

Immidiently, my mind turns toward the internship offers I received. Purdue has done a really good job with career services. The industrial roundtable career fair was an amazing opportunity.

But was it worth $45,000?

The one internship I really wanted was with ARM. I had learned ARM assembly in the past and done some projects with it before including creating an ARM emulator in javascript.

I was asked to do an interview, but funny enough I saw the questions before and realized I was not at all qualified for this position.

I remember seeing somethign about branch predictors and optimizations for some processor stuff and I noped out of the situation.

I'm not mad at myself for not going through with the interview, I would have embarresed myself. I knew I was going to take a year to study advanced computer architecture in school and try again.

In fact, there are a lot of advanced topics that I really want to study. In fact, those advanced topics are the reason I came to this school.

However, I recently learned that because of prerequisties I would not be able to take this course until the end of my academic career. 

What the heck.

I spent $45,000 this year to take a course in basic level Java and C (they were both intersting and I learned alot but come on, I know the languages, I want to take these advanced courses).

To add salt to my wound, I haven't worked on any side projects the entire academic year. In the past I was averaging 1200 commits a year, I would be happy with just 100 this year. 

I had all these projects done in high school, but no internships came until I started at Purude.

Did the @purdue.edu email change that much. Was it worth $45,000?

Not doing projects is my own fault, and I take full responsibility for that. However, with the amount of stupid work I'm being assigned in school it just feels pointless to work on my own stuff.

I get caught in a cycle of studying for tests, taking a week break to spend time with friends or doing something else, and then jumping back into it.

And its not that I don't have ideas. My backlog is only growing. I just don't feel like working on fun projects. It feels like there is always something more important to attend to.

### My plan moving forward
1. Take advantage of the resources Purdue actually offers
2. Force myself to code every week
