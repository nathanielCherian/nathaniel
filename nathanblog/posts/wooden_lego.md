On the morning of Monday Jan 29th 2024 at around 9:30AM I had just woken up but didn't feel like getting out of bed. It was too early, I didn't have class, and I didn't have any work to do.

Thats when the idea just popped in my head: how cool would it be to have a massive wooden lego block just sitting on my desk. I wasn't sure if this was even possible, but then I remembered our school's massive makerspace the Bechtel Innovation Design Center (BIDC).

I hopped out of bed, joined the BIDC discord and asked for a consult. No one was available, but the front desk said to check back later that day. I went back and met in-person with an expert in the woodshop. I told him my idea and he explained how we could build it. I wanted the block to be made out of a single piece of wood, so he recommended using the CNC gantry. He was kind enough to walk me through the process of selecting wood, creating stock, and finally creating the instructions for the gantry.

I went down to the stock room and chose a nice plank of Yellow Poplar wood. I took note of the dimensions and began my CAD model.

I study computer science, and have barely used the software Fusion360. But I found a tutorial for a [simple lego brick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yPKMSb6ja8). Once I had created the model I had to create the manufacturing plan for the brick. Thankfully, Fusion360 has great support for doing this.

First was to cut out the top face of the block. This was pretty straightforward. Just had to be mindful of the spacing of the studs and the drill bit diameter.

Next was to do the bottom of the brick. This was significantly more challenging and required making some sacrifices: how big did I want the block to be, how did I want the inside to look, was I willing to give up some details.
