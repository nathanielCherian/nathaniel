Different theories of law all try to answer the basic question “What is a law”. In Plato’s Republic,
Thrasycamus provides an account of law closest to reality in his position that “justice is the interest of the
stronger” despite overlooking the distinctions between “justice” and “law”. I will explore Thrasycamus’s
position, respond to objections from Socrates, and modify Thrasycamus’ original idea of justice to create
a more accurate account of law.

In Plato’s Republic, Socrates debates with Polemarchus about what is “just.” Thrasycamus,
itching to join in the conversation makes the claim, to strong reactions, that “justice is nothing other than
what is advantageous for the stronger” (CMPT 82). Thrasycamus is saying that “justice” is none other
than a construct created by the strong to suppress the weak. He clarifies this point later saying that “a just
man must always get less than an unjust one. ” when pitted against each other (CMPT 86, 343d).
The gut reaction to this statement is often immediate disagreement. However, we could concede
that unjust people do in fact take advantage of just people, say in a business agreement. But most of the
time, we see unjust people being penalized for their actions, whether by the law or shame from society (an
unjust person will lose business). But if one had the mystical “Ring of Gyges” (CMPT 94, 359d) which
removed repercussions or damage to reputation through invisibility would being just all the time still be
profitable?

Either way, Thrasycamus maintains that “injustice if it is on a large enough scale, is stronger,
freer, and more masterful than justice” (CMPT 86, 344c) He uses stealing as an example. Common people
would label stealing “unjust”, however, when the stealing is done by the stronger, say a tyrant, it is
considered a good action. In American society, this could be eminent domain. If the government believes
that taking your land will “benefit the entire community” (Cornell Law, 2022), it will be favorably looked
upon by “common people” to “steal” your property 1. For this reason, it seems that what is “just” is
relative to who is the strongest person in the situation.

Responding to Thrasycamus, Socrates first makes the argument that ruling is a type of ‘craft’
similar to a doctor or a horse breeder. He then explains how ‘crafts’ serve to benefit only what their craft
is. “Medicine does not consider what is advantageous for medicine, but for the body” (CMPT 85, 342b)
similarly a horse breeder considers what is advantageous to his horses – not himself. The same can be said
about teaching. A teacher’s duty is to promote the education of their students. The purpose of their “rule”
is to benefit the students, not the teacher. Socrates would say that a king engages in a similar ‘craft’ to the
teacher – thus the king’s laws should be advantageous to his people. This contradicts Thrasycamus’ claim
that the actions of a ruler will be to serve their interests alone. After all, a king could easily abuse his
power to serve himself. Socrates clarifies his position with an example of a shepherd fattening their sheep
to be killed. He asserts that a shepherd who raises their sheep for profit is just a “money-maker” not a
“shepherd” in the proper sense (CMPT 87, 345c). This shows that a king who abuses their power to serve
their own interests cannot be called a ruler, but instead maybe a businessman.

Socrates also disagrees that injustice will always be more rewarding than justice. To prove this he
appeals to morals, saying that a “soul [can never] perform its functions … if it is deprived of its own
proper virtue.” (CMPT 93, 353d) He claims that justice itself is a virtue to be prized over injustice, and
thus a person cannot be truly happy (the ultimate aim in life) without being just. In saying that injustice
isn’t an obvious choice, Socrates knocks out a crucial premise of Thrasycamus’ argument that the strong keep the weak from doing injustice though it is “profitable and good for oneself” (CMPT 86, 344c).
Injustice cannot be completely profitable for oneself because it limits satisfaction in life.

While Thrasycamus’account of justice is intriguing, the relationship between justice and morality
posed by Socrates is too damaging to the idea that “justice is in the interest of the stronger”. However, if
Thrasycamus’ justice is a “legal” justice, then he is right to say that the law is in the interest of the
stronger.

If laws are in the interest of the stronger, then laws must enrich the stronger. However, at a
minimum, this means that laws should maintain the ‘strength’ of the stronger. Take for example the rule
of an evil dictator. It would be obvious to say that this ruler would make rules that keep him in power and
avoid rules that open the door to rebellion. However, the same principle applies to a perfectly benevolent
king who loves his subjects and desires only the best for them. By definition, this benevolent ruler will
make every law benefit his people, however, he will not make a law allowing them to throw him out of
power. In this king’s desire to do what is best for his people, he will not allow them to dethrone him as
doing so could lead to an evil person taking power. Thus, even in the case of a benevolent king, the laws
he makes will always be in his interest.

This logic can also be generalized to situations where a ruler may not be benevolent. The
argument that “law is in the interest of the stronger” can be reduced to the argument that laws should
never undermine the authority of the stronger.
1. The function of a ruler is to make laws.
2. Laws can only be considered “laws” if backed up by punishment. Otherwise, they are
merely obligations (“you ought to follow this law because it is the right thing to do”)
3. A ruler without the ability to enforce laws has essentially nullified all of their laws (from
Cherian 4
2)
4. A ruler cannot be called a ruler if their laws are nullified. Thus, A ruler should prioritize
their ability to enforce laws, lest lose the title of “ruler” (from 3 & 1)
5. A ruler can protect their ability to enforce laws, through their laws
6. Laws defend the ability of a ruler to enforce their laws and thus stay a ruler.
7. Laws are in the interest of the stronger

Now going back to Socrates' first objection. The ‘craft’ of being a ruler is fundamentally different
than the craft of teaching or medicine. If a ruler does not maintain his authority, he is at risk of being
usurped by his own ‘craft.’ In medicine, the body won’t stage rebellion if you fail to protect your own
interests.

Objection 1: If the benevolent king truly loves his people so much, then his interests are in the wellbeing
of his people. So, if laws are in the interest of the king, and the king’s interests are in the well-being of his
people, then by transitive property, laws would be in the best interest of the people – not the king.
Reply 1: This is accurate, but now I can ask: what would be in the interest of the people’s well-being?
Given that the king is “perfectly benevolent,” it is in the best interest of the subjects for the king to stay in
power. Thus, even still, laws serve to benefit the interest of the king to sustain his power and benevolence.
Objection 2: In a tyrannical nation, it is easy to see how the law is used to serve the interests of the
stronger, but what about a democracy, like America, where the “stronger” (say the president) allows for
laws to create a peaceful transition of power from them to their predecessor? This seems to violate the
principle that the stronger can’t make laws (in the proper sense) that damage their power.

Reply 2: I would like to make the bold claim that in a democracy, like America, the stronger is none other
than the Constitution. No doubt, this claim is far from what Thrasycamus would have intended when
talking about the “stronger”. He intended “the stronger” to be a human with desires and personal
motivations, not ink on parchment. Though stretching the limits of the argument, I think there is value in
analyzing how the law serves the interest of the stronger to keep them in power.
In America, the strongest is neither the president nor legislators or even the courts. All of these
political systems have been set up and given power through the Constitution. In fact, all federal
employees and military swear to defend, not the presidency, but the Constitution.
Notice how the consitution models a “benevolent dictator”. It gives rights and freedom to all,
except the right and freedom to overthrow the Constitution itself. Yes, the Constitution provides methods
for amendments, but secession itself is illegal. This has been tested most notably through the American
Civil War. The outcome of this led to the court decision of Texas V. White which declared unilateral
secession unconstitutional (Texas V. White, 2023).

Even if secession was “legal”, the constitution still has power over the American public through a
“lesser evil” dilemma. Overthrowing and rewriting the Constitution would bring more chaos than
benefits. Thus, we are essentially locked into our constitution unless conditions are dire enough to justify
destroying it and starting anew.

Though just ink on parchment, the primary laws outlined in the constitution give power to
secondary laws of the federal, state, and local legislation. If congress oversteps its constitutional limit, its
legislative authority would be immediately dismissed. The constitution enforces its power through the
people who subscribe to it – the equivalent of a king’s army.

Responses to the question of what defines law may forever remain clouded by doubts and edge
cases. However, the clearest answer to this question can be found in the ancient text of Plato’s Republic
when Thrasycamus claims that justice is in the interest of the stronger. It has been shown that while his
view fails to consider justice in the moral sense, it accurately describes a characteristic of law that serves
the interest of the stronger.
