Paternalistic laws are designed to protect an individual from making a decision that will harm themself. However, this creates a tension between individual freedom and state intervention. In his book On Liberty, John Stuart Mill explores the question of balancing personal autonomy and societal protection. Mill condemns paternalistic laws by reasoning that individuals know what is best for their happiness. However, Mill fails to consider that humans are vulnerable to irrational behavior which can lead to decisions that are unequivocally harmful to oneself. Hence, paternalistic laws are necessary to protect people from the shortcomings of their judgment. 

All actions can be broadly divided into two categories: those that affect others and those that only affect oneself. Murder would fall in the first category, while drug usage that affects only the drug user would fall into the latter. Mill claims through the ‘Harm Principle’ that laws should only regulate actions that fall solely within the first category (concerning others). Mill writes, “The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others” (CMPT 940). Mill allows individuals to exercise their freedom under the condition that their actions do not hurt other people. Conversely, this implies that it is wrong for the law to punish the same person it is trying to protect. 

Mill defends this limited view of government by emphasizing that an individual will know what choices are best for them to achieve happiness. When an action does not affect others, it can be thought of as a ‘preference’. While society excels in creating laws that regulate interpersonal actions, it fails to capture the diverse individual preferences of the people. Different people require different preferences to be happy. Thus, control over preferences should reside with each person. Mill writes, “The interference of society to overrule his judgment and purposes in what only regards himself must be grounded on general presumptions; which may be altogether wrong, and even if right, are as likely as not to be misapplied to individual cases. (CMPT 974)” For example, using marijuana may be a bad choice for some. Yet, for others suffering from chronic illness, marijuana may be the only solution that provides relief from their pain. It may be counter-productive to a person's well-being for society to apply the preferences of the majority to individuals. 

Mill's principle protects individual liberty but fails to accommodate the shortcomings of human judgment. Indeed, each person has their best interest in mind. However, it is untrue that each person will always execute properly in their best interest. This could be due to a temporary lapse in judgment, but may also point to a deeper fact about human psychology. Our judgment is vulnerable to exploits and clouded by a laundry list of cognitive biases. For example, casino slot machines exploit variable reinforcement to keep players hooked (O’Malley & Tunney, 2016). This is a form of conditioning where rewards are given irregularly to keep players continually engaged. Additionally, cults use manipulative practices to recruit members and convince them to commit terrible and irrational actions – for example, the 1978 Jonestown (Eldridge, 2023) and 1997 Heaven's Gate (Melton, 2023) mass suicides. For both the example of casinos and cults, a person attempts to follow their best interest under a psychological bias or misguided belief but is unable to avoid the action that is unequivocally harmful to them and against their best interest. 

Paternalistic laws consider and account for the complexities of human behavior with punishments meant to discourage harmful actions. Seatbelt laws remain a prime example of how punishments can overcome bad human judgment. The statistics prove that wearing a seatbelt will prevent fatal injury in a car crash – few people would claim otherwise. Yet people in a hurry simply forget to wear their seatbelt or downplay the potential risks. This is a perfect example of optimism bias. People underestimate the likelihood of rare adverse events happening to them (Sharot, 2011). Though fatal, a car accident is a low-likelihood event, which causes people to neglect basic safety precautions in the case that it happens. The minor decision to not wear a seatbelt, which is due in part to irrational decision-making, could lead to devastating consequences that clearly oppose the best interest of the person. There exists room for the government to correct biases and actions that could lead to serious consequences or death – the ultimate unhappiness . In the context of seatbelt laws, punishing law-breakers with fines compensates for this cognitive bias. Even if people do not believe they could get in a serious car accident because of its low likelihood, they are motivated to buckle up to avoid a small fine if there is a higher likelihood of them getting caught. In this way, the punishment is not meant to incapacitate the wrong-doer but rather to make the action of not wearing a seatbelt less desirable, thus promoting people’s welfare and happiness (i.e. more people surviving car accidents). 

Mill may argue that this viewpoint sacrifices personal liberty. Mill acknowledges that sometimes people will make mistakes, but claims that allowing people the freedom to make mistakes is favorable to restricting their freedom. He writes, “All errors which he is likely to commit against advice and warning, are far outweighed by the evil of allowing others to constrain him to what they deem his good. (CMPT 974)”. In saying that people ought to be able to make mistakes so long as they are free to do so, Mill places liberty as a defining human characteristic, such that one can not live a fulfilled life without liberty. If someone was living in captivity, but had all of their needs met, they cannot be truly happy as they lack freedom. Mill emphasizes that the value of individual liberty lies not only in avoiding mistakes but also in the intrinsic fulfillment that comes from the ability to make choices to navigate one's own life.

While idealistic and good in thought, this viewpoint overlooks the reality of the situation. For actions that result in serious consequences, losing a minor freedom may be better than the alternative: death. In the context of seatbelt laws, Mill's position would stipulate that the fatal error of not wearing a seatbelt is better than the alternative in which the law uses power to enforce seatbelt use. A simple fine could mean the difference between life and death. It is hard to justify that the freedom incurred from avoiding this fine is worth more than the lives it could potentially save. It may not be the case that individual autonomy is the source of happiness. In the case of a driver who exercises autonomy by not wearing a seatbelt and suffers a serious injury, the autonomy may become the source of his unhappiness. Even though the seatbelt law infringes on one’s liberty, a small penalty could prevent bad judgment from harming the individual. A parent would encourage their child to make mistakes and learn from them but will prevent the child from making a mistake that leads to death or irreversible damage. In the same way, the state should be allowed to infringe on an individual's liberty on matters that directly lead to death or other consequences that are too serious to learn from.

While Mill's principle of individuality remains a strong tenant of Western culture, the notion that an individual knows and acts according to what is best for them is flawed due to the potentially irrational judgment of humans. For this reason, it is the responsibility of the government to create laws with punishments that make actions that are unequivocally bad less attractive for the sake of protecting an individual from the consequences of their bad judgment.
