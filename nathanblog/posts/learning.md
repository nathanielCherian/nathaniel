Project based learning gets students ready for a career by exposing them to their future field. It's amazing. The one weakness: standardized testing.

## What is Project Based Learning?
Project based learning promotes a headfirst approach to learning to code. In traditional classroom, fundamentals are taught through rote memorization to a classroom of bored students. Not only does this disengage learners, it creates a mental burden for students who feel that what they are learning is useless and impractical.


In contrast, PBL encourages students to build real-world applications ***right off the block*** and learn the fundamentals along the way. Not only does this show students that the world of professional programming is not too far away, it increases retention and participation in class.

Modern frameworks and tools have made it incredibly easy for students to dive straight into the deep end without fear of being drowned in documentation (at least right away). The two best examples of this are XCode and Flask. Both close the gap between products (apps & websites) and what students can make with little to no experience.

## Problems with PBL

Project based learning takes a "swiss cheese" approach to coding. Through self-exploration, student gain a vast amount of knowledge over a short period of time, but this comes at the cost of leaving "holes" in their knowledge — fundamentals that haven't been uncovered.

In a professional setting, these gaps are for the most part harmless. Time and experience will slowly patch the holes. In school, however, these benign holes become dangerous.

For example, students taking AP Computer Science in High school must take the AP test at the end of the year to measure their knowldege. The test doesn't care whether you have practical skills that will make you a better member of the workforce or that you have developed the ability to learn to languages and frameworks quickly. It only cares that you know the rules of Java. Most of which you'll come across through completed projects, but some will elude your work and hurt you on the test.

## The Solution
What PBL really needs to be successful in the classroom is a proper supplement. While students work on projects to further their skillset and improve their resume they also need to work on learning the fundamentals from the bottom-up. This **two sided approach** gives students the best of both worlds and by the time the tracks coverge they will be ready to take the test and move on with their careers.

When I was preparing for my AP Computer Science Test, I found myself doing countless amounts of practice questions to find areas that I haven't covered through my many projects. To my surprise, by the end of it all, I hadn't found a single topic tested by AP not covered by my work. Instead, I had a list of over 30 *"gotchas"* — nuances in the language that could lead to confusion on the test.

These "gotchas" (that's what I'll refer to them as now) weren't neccesarily difficult to understand. You would come across it, have an "aha" moment, and remember it when you see it in another problem.

In the end, I was able to save precious review time during AP week, by quickly going over the list rather than re-study everything.

Gotchas are not taught with the curriculum. The only way to find them is by working through problems until one pops out. What Project based learning really needs is a simple tool that will quickly and efficently cover the missing fundamentals of PBL while skipping through basic topics.
